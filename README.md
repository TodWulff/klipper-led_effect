# LED Effects for Klipper

## Description

This is the standalone repository of the Klipper LED Effects module developed by Paul McGowan with contributions from myself.
It allows Klipper to run effects and animations on addressable LEDs, such as Neopixels, WS2812 or SK6812.

## Disclaimer
**This is work in progress and not ready for production use yet. Not all effects are working and the documentation might be outdated.**
If you want to help by testing or contributing, please contact me on Discord: Hagbard#7867

## Installation

The module can be installed into a existing Klipper installation with an install script. 

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect.git
    cd klipper-led_effect
    ./install-led_effect.sh
