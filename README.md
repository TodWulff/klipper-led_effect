# LED Effects for Klipper

## Description

This is the standalone repository of the Klipper LED Effects module developed by [Paul McGowan](https://github.com/mental405) with contributions from myself.
It allows Klipper to run effects and animations on addressable LEDs, such as Neopixels, WS2812 or SK6812.
